Once upon a time in a forest, there lived a monkey who reside on a berry tree, which was the bank of the river. 
In the same forest there lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day, the crocodile came to the bank of the river and rested under the tree.
The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits.
The crocodile came back the next day for some fruits.
As days passed by, the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.
One day, the monkey sent some fruits for the crocodile's wife.
She at the fruits and liked them, but was jealous as she didn't liked her husband spending time with the monkey.
She told her husband, "If the fruits are so juice, I wonder how sweet the monkey's heart would be. Get me the heart of the monkey."
The cocodile was not willing to kill his friend, but had no choice.
